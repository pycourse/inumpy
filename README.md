# inumpy: Introduction to NumPy Using iPython Notebook

## Synopsis

This one-day workshop introduces [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), the
fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, and how to use its
building blocks.  We will use [iPython](http://ipython.org/) (or equivalently,
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)) notebook, an excellent interactive computing
system, as the key interface to the numerical library.  Although iPython is a
great companion of NumPy, the former is not only useful in the numerical
computing.

## Prerequisites

Attendees should be familiar with Python and Unix-based terminal operations
(command-line user interface).  Attendees should bring their own computers.
The workshop will prepare a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual
machine image of Ubuntu Linux that is loaded with the necessary software
packages and the workshop materials.
